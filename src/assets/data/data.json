      "subContent1": "I started this position as a mid-level programmer, and there is no doubt that Amdocs is a fun place to work at. Most of my day revolves around a new Amdocs product for the Asia-Pacific part of the world. I love new products as they give me an opportunity to be creative and improve the product. The product was developed by hundreds of programmers which requires a well-designed pipeline, use of TypeScript, and lots of tests. It is one of the most interesting products I have ever worked on. I enjoy working on every line of code.",
      "subTitle2": "What I like about the position",
      "subContent2": "Working on a product written by hundreds of programmers, the rapid pace of development, a complex product, all of these required a high level of discipline from me. Thinking outside the box, mentoring the other programmers. And I did this all with great love.",
      "subTitle3": "What I learned in this position",
      "subContent3": "To manage the development of a product written by lots of programmers, to work with TDD Jenkins pipelines, and to use TypeScript for neatly written code."

Then examining the PO and stories. Later in the morning, planning out the day with Daily. Then, to my favorite part of the day, writing the code.",
      "subTitle2": "What I like about the position",
      "subContent2": "I loved working on a great enterprise product. The amount of code in the product was huge. This forced me to read the code carefully and learn the design pattern and rules of the code, to identify what is right, what is wrong and where it can be improved.\nAs a result of the vast knowledge I acquired in addition to the knowledge I already had with React, I was given the task of upgrading a version of React for the product.",
      "subTitle3": "What I learned in this position",
      "subContent3": "I learned to work with Jira, write and read JavaScripts OOP . Work with staff from different countries. Debug the code at the highest level."

      "execution": "With an investment of 40 hours in development, a sales site was launched. In addition, there was an investment of NIS 2,000 into photos, and NIS 2,000 into Google Ads campaigns. The site generated in one month an income of NIS 20,000. But with zero percent profit. The majority of the margin between the cost of the product and the advertising fees was taken by the merchants. Hence the realization that the flower market was not a worthwhile market for me."

      "p4": "The truth is, it was a challenge I had to take on. No matter what he offered, I would have agreed to develop it. We decided on an investment of $100,000 where I would invest 25% percent and become a full partner in the venture.",
      "p5": "I recruited an Israeli team that relocated to China, a penthouse in a western tourist area in Foshan. And we set off, right from the beginning we pivoted to an app that matches people who have a problem with a professional who can fix it. Within 8 months we prepared the MVP and were ready for the pilot and beta testing. Our failure came from the business sideâ€¦"
